_**Michael:**_

So, the Bank of International Settlement is run by obviously Jellyman - you guys are in Mexico, so the former governor of the Reserve Bank of Mexico, Jellyman Augustine Carstens. And obviously in that top bracket you have the 64 members central banks, which is obviously like the Fed. So basically if you speak English, even if you understand English, there's a very strong chance your central bank is in there. So what they do is they obviously control the monetary, are able to filter to any agenda they see for completely distorting markets and funds - any agenda that they want to implement and defund any agenda that they see as resistance or don't want to implement.

So below them, you have the global think tanks. This is obviously your plow swaps, your world economic forums, your Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Chatham House, et cetera. And there's actually a million of them. They're all, you know, Washington lobby groups, et cetera, et cetera. But what these guys do is essentially formulate the policy, have the money filtered to them. Formulate the policy for the entire world, say whether it's the great research or whatever, right?

Below them you have, I suppose, the enforcers, so the intergovernmental organizations. So these multinational organizations generally have been weaponized to achieve a single goal, or at least a goal in general. So we see very, very often the World Bank and the International Monetary Funds being used as, I suppose, the parrot on the stick, if you will, or at least the stick behind the animals to beat them. So the IMF and the World Bank will obviously will often give loans to whether it's developing nations or just nations in general under the conditions that they implement the policies set above at whether it's and whether it's you know what coming foreign policies or whether it's monetary policies like the SWIFT system set out by the BIS and the Federal Reserve.

Now below this you have them implemented at a national level. Most people actually think that, you know, in a democratic society, they vote for somebody. And that's actually, they believe it's a much more decentralized world that is. They think that their government's in control of them, and say for my case, this Chinese government's in control of me, the US government's in control of the US. But it's actually played at a much higher level, as you can see. So these guys are just implementing them on a national level.

And below them you have businesses of the world, So your massive tech companies that, you know, censor people and enforce the laws, kick people out, individuals out, if they don't comply by these laws. Obviously the SWIFT system, JP Morgan, the list goes on, you could write a complete book about this power structure.

So their agendas, and this is not the funny thing I find when explaining to normal people, is they often think that you're guessing or you're making things up or something, maybe even somewhere in between, but these agendas are actually on the websites of, you know, organizations like the BIS, Federal Reserve, like the World Economic Forum. They're literally going out and saying they want this future.

So CBDCs is completely programmable money, I'm sure you're all aware, and allow them to manipulate any aspect of the currency they want. So it's just a couple of examples. They could put time limits on your money, so if you don't spend it in a certain amount of time, that money, restrictions on what you can spend it on, uh, you can lose access to your bank account file, unapproved transactions, or dissipated unapproved activities such as protesting COVID lockdowns or whatever have you at the time. And what this means is that you lose all your monetary freedom. And as I say, monetary freedom is really at the basis of human expression. So you use your freedom of expression and just one consequence of time limits and all these kinds of things is you lose your right to store wealth. And that's as if, you know, the devaluation of fiat alone wasn't enough. You actually directly lose your right to store wealth.

So digital IDs. I'm sure everybody listening is pretty much all over this, as is most people in the Monero and privacy community. I won't touch on it too much, but these can come in full with things like vaccine passports or movement licenses or whatever.

And the last agenda that we'll cover on a very high level is the social credit scores. So when you implement all these together, social credit scores, CBDCs, digital IDs, you could even be incredibly convenient and have them all in one app together, you can see that this really pays the way to lose pretty much all freedoms or at absolute minimum - you're setting up yourself in a digital panopticon. And obviously social credit scores is a system that can be governments or businesses to rank you and determine what activities you're allowed to do based on how good a citizen you are, right? Like we see this in China at the moment. People are ranked on things by what they're buying at the grocery store. People are tracked and ranked on whether they're visiting the elderly grandparents. It's a completely dystopian society and we're putting ourselves or at least the global power structure wants to put us in a position where we're in a digital panopticon. So we have to bow to their every will.

So the question is, how do we actually fix this, right? So these two problems are only covered at an incredibly high level, but to give you an answer at a high level too, proof of work and privacy is what really fixes this. And we'll get into that.

So proof of work provides long lasting prosperity. So because you're limited by spending real world resources to obtain Monero, no one can essentially steal your time like they can with fiat. It essentially puts you back onto a gold pipe system where you have to provide work to actually increase the supply. And the monetary policy is set in stone and no centralized authority can change it. In society, as we mentioned at the start, the consequences of decisions are retied to those who make the decisions. So you actually have to provide value to people in order to obtain money. So that means if you want to bail out a bank, you have to have been productive in the first place to then go and give your money away, which obviously nobody's gonna donate billions, hundreds of billions of dollars to officially irresponsible to say the least organization.

And privacy provides us freedom from the globalist technology that they're wanting to implement. So privacy provides monetary freedom. It protects you financially and allows you to interact as you see fit. It gives you back autonomy over your money, which as I say is the most true form of freedom of expression. And this allows us or societies in general to build based on the true demands of people and have economies form that don't require third party approval, which is again, at the essence of what freedom is.

So these things we've covered are at a high level. I've obviously given the length of the talk to cut out a vast majority of things of the book. Let's stack up the cards on a pretty high level, on a quick and high level. We'll go through it in 20 points about essentially the essence of the talk and the essence of the book.

So fiat money is not real money. The fiat monetary system benefits only those close to the monetary spigot. Fiat is obviously a mathematical currency. An alternative money structure system is going to be needed. As we discussed more in length in the book, reform is not able to change itself. And that's even if fiat wasn't a ponzi. Revolutionary cycles, and this has got a whole chapter dedicated to it, revolutionary cycles are all converging to provide a platform for natural revolutionary change. We see a natural change in the gas. So we have the 50 year technological revolution. We have an 80 year political, societal revolution and a 250 year empire revolution. And as I say, all these cycles are converging all at once.

Short and long term debt cycles are converging. So if anyone's familiar with Ray Dalio's thesis on, well, not even thesis, just Ray Dalio's study on short and long term debt cycles. Generation cycles are converged as well. So that's obviously when strong men create good times, good times create weak men, weak men create hard times, hard men, hard times create strong men, and et cetera, et cetera.

At the global power structure, as we explore in the book, has an incredible amount of power to implement whatever agendas they see fit, whether that's the post utopian agendas or whether that's as they've outlined, socialist dystopian agendas.

A future filled with technocracy and globalism will only serve to increase centralization, reduce individual liberty, serve to benefit the very few elites closest to the monetary spigot and reduce the prosperity of the everyday person.

Now, as you know, with every empire in history, and especially a falling empire with a lot to lose, extreme efforts are always made to keep that power structure in place. So this is gonna be the exact same. Any effort to de-platform the global power structure is gonna be met with stiff militant resistance. I mean, literally militant, they will get the army up.

The solution to technocracy and globalism is the decentralization and privatization of money. And that's not obviously giving the money to a company. That's quite literally making money private. Creating privacy tools.

Obviously summed up two main problems are fiat, the fiat ponzi, and technology slash globalism. The solution to fake fiat money is hard proof of work money. Money that has real value and can't be manipulated. And the solution to technocracy and globalism is privacy tools and technology that can't be stopped. And that's simply. At the end of the day, that's mathematics.

Now, obviously the method of math/ tool that counters the current and future weapons of global power structure should be used to achieve best results. As you have with any problem in life, you want to be using the best tool to achieve the best results.

Now, Monero is that method and it's actually, in my understanding, or at least opinion, it's only method. Monero is decentralized. It is private proof of work money.

Now, the last thing we want to make is Monero provides the best basis we've ever seen, we've ever had as a species for long, for building a long lasting platform for freedom and prosperity.

Gratuitas and Monero._

_**Michael:**_ So the title of the book, right? The Monero Standard. So how do we move to the Monero Standard? We've obviously covered a lot of these points already, so we won't bang on about them too much.

But essentially, new technologies are adopted according to the perceived value to the user. So I always found to use the invention and adoption of radar technology. Now radar technology was adopted, at least on maths, by the British in World War II. And as we see, difficult times were needed to happen in order for them to adopt that. So obviously we had, you know, the Battle for Britain, a lot of German bombers coming over, bombing London, et cetera. Those were difficult times. And that's what, you know, that's what made them adopted. They had no other choice but to adopt it.

And as we've outlined, difficult times are coming. Again, we see through the control of the monetary supply, and we see that the agendas are there, that they openly come out and say that they want to make that.

So, fiat is gonna force people to look for alternative monies and a monetary system that could provide more value to them by solving the current problems with fiat. And with the dystopia world that we're moving into, people, as I say, are gonna be forced to adopt monetary networks with complete privacy, proof of work and privacy.

The road to adoption. So it's really not important that these all play out or they play out in this event, but there's some things we're gonna see on the road to Monero, an increased amount of Monero adoption, whether you wanna call that mainstream adoption, niche adoption or whatever the case, right? So we're gonna continue to see adoption on the darknet and black markets.

This is actually a massively important one. All new technologies, including money, is adopted on the fringes, right? So by criminals, by the oppressed, et cetera, et cetera. People are in these positions, are literally adopting Monero at the moment. They've moved past Bitcoin. Bitcoin served its purpose at the time. There was flaws found in it, in regards to transparency/privacy. And now people are moving on to the next thing. So that is Monero. And Monero seems to fill all the problems.

So cash to be banned, this is obviously going to happen. The governments are putting out fiats all across the world - CBCDs, we already talked about this, social credit scores, digital IDs.

Now, a cultural thing is we've seen a lot of people, increasing the amount of people concerned about their privacy, either personal or for business. I did a podcast with Justin Ehrenhoffer about last December, I think it was. He mentioned in the podcast that the difference in people that care about privacy between now when he got in Monero is not today. And it really got me thinking. I think the exact same thing too. I've noticed, I think it had a lot to do with Snowden and these kinds of people. People now are caring a lot more about their personal privacy and that it's privacy of their business. And we're gonna continue to see attitudes like this develop on a wide scale across society.

Obviously they're gonna start, you know, own nothing and be happy they're going to ban things like meat, they've already talked about these eat the bugs, etc. They're going to ban salt. We're going to see Bitcoin and other transparent protocols, heavily regulated, track and manipulated. As I said before, they're literally going to throw the kitchen sink at stopping at everything that threatens their position in the global power structure. So Bitcoin is going to, it does threaten their position in the global power structure. The problem is that through transparency, a lot of other problems pop up, which we won't get into in this talk. But it essentially, because it can be heavily regulated, it can be tracked, it can ultimately be manipulated. And I believe you essentially take the team that are like, you know, God, so let's hear that a lot.

We're gonna see more events like the Canadian trucker protests, like the Dutch farmer protests, et cetera, et cetera going to be kicked out of the system. And they're not going to have any other choice but to look for alternatives. We see this today with obviously, you know, the countries like Russia, like North Korea, Iran, Libya, Yemen, the list goes on. So these people are already kicked out of the current system.

We're going to, again, I don't think this is actually massively important, but I think we will see, well, I think we could potentially see adoption of small nations, adoption of legal tender. I don't think that matters at all because at the end of the day, we're here to take over, we're not here to take part. So what the government does is completely irrelevant. Again, tax is paid in Monero as a state. And another important thing that most people won't think about is the extreme volatility we're gonna see as lawmakers and as the current power institutions become increasingly irrational and desperate to keep their place there.

So a great example of that is gold, a famous example of gold in the Weimar Republic, where volatility, you know, up 1000%, down 90%, up 10,000%, down 95%, et cetera, et cetera. And this obviously shakes a lot of people out. It makes a lot of people scared and go back to the old system. So that's just something to be prepared for.

I'm going to tap, what can you do? We need you, right? So the average Joe, people like me, you can obviously build a culture home base. It doesn't have to be on a national level. You don't have to make an entire city like Bitcoin Beach. But we need to start building out communities where you can allow the culture, where people can come together and you can allow the culture to expand. Obviously we're more powerful together than we are divided, right?

More books about Monero. I've write the Monero Standard at the moment. I can guarantee if you ask any of my teachers in school, they would absolutely guarantee that I'd never write a book in my life. They'd probably say I'd fail and be in jail by now.

More academic level courses. More - hey, this is a super easy one - Monero YouTube videos, right? Anybody can do this. We need more Monero content out there. And not for a Bitcoin circle jerk reason. But quite literally, we need it in different languages and we need the community to grow. And the more people who are talking about it, the more we can spread that message.

I was lobbying politicians to make Monero friendly laws. I've actually done this. I've messaged two senators from my state and one, what do you call it? Representative from my local area and not a single one has replied, right? But that's not to say you shouldn't try it, because if we get enough people messaging about it, if you just have one person like me messaging about it, one, they've probably never heard of it, two, they only get one person mentioned about it, they don't care. But when we get enough people, like in Bitcoin at the moment, when you get enough people lobbying politicians to advocate for it, to start donating to the politicians, to make friendly laws, that can really start to make a difference. Obviously, they'll come into politicians who don't wanna know you regardless, but that's the point. It's something that you can do.

I just heard Luke Smith talking in a previous talk about onboarding new users, which are definitely onboarding users, but also onboard vendors, if you will. That's your local shops, etc.

Hosting events, we went through this. Running nodes committing hash power to them. I could actually do that. That's the beauty of Monero. That's the beauty of CPU mining. Is it quite literally anyone can do it at home. You don't need any specialized hardware at all.

Developers - plenty of options. Browser wallets, easy to use, perfect wallets - Cakes doing a good job of that - atomic swaps, DeFi bridges, Monero only exchanges, that would be quite a unique idea, big tech resistant wallets - I think that's gonna be massively, massively important in the future. Monero first/dominated exchanges and obviously integration into other web applications.

Now, the last two things we talked about, so the average John developers, what you guys do, what we do, doesn't matter unless we build a circular economy, and vice versa too. Building a circular economy doesn't matter unless we do those things as well. So by building a circular economy, we need in real life places that in Monero. So whether that's, go down to your local shops, tell them that you're gonna go buy a meat from the local butcher, I'll pay you a Monero, I'll come by all my meat and I'll feed you, a vegetable shop, do the exact same thing. Building a circular economy also involves wholesalers and manufacturers, accept in Monero, and that's quite literally the whole circle from producers, all the way to consumers back to producers, right?

Wages paid in Monero would be fantastic. Commodities priced in Monero as well. That's still probably a little wild off, but that's another thing in regards to building a circular economy. Again, as I say, getting places to accept Monero, spend Monero on food, if you can rent, if you can healthcare, goods, services, and obviously tipping within the community. Monero VCs to fund Monero startups, that would be a big one. And that would be again, wholesalers, manufacturers, retailers, et cetera.

XMR GoFundMe alternatives, I think is a very powerful one. So interesting stuff coming out of NOSTA, not technologically savvy enough to say how Monero can be integrated into that, but I know Bitcoin is really not based on NOSTA, completely decentralized as such. So there is no reason in my technological understanding why this is the same product done with. That couldn't be done with Monero. A cool idea I had actually was Monero payments square, just Monero companies and yeah, also another thing is partnering with Human Rights Organizations to highlight the public aspects of privacy. You could go on and you could take a lot of paths in regards to that.

So that's actually a lie. I still haven't changed it, but it's coming out soon. So if anybody's interested in learning more, I really believe that this book is a phenomenal book. It really breaks down the incredible depth. I mean, what we covered today in the speech is really nothing. And what we did cover is at an incredibly high level. So you can go onto the website, monerostandard.com, grab yourself for pre-order a copy for yourself.

And, hey, what else can I say? Thanks. I'm, I don't know if anybody's got any questions, but if you do, I don't know, you have to go through the moderator or how we do this. Stop sharing my screen. Is there any questions from anybody at all?

_**Alex:**_ I'm not sure if you can see the questions, but privacydad just asked: can you comment on EU regulations voted on last month?

_**Michael:**_ What specific regulations are you talking about?

_**Alex:**_ Say anything past that?

_**Michael:**_ Yeah. Yeah. I'm not an expert on, I didn't even know what happened to be honest. So unless you could enlighten me with that. Like I'm trading. No, I don't know. I don't know anything about it truth be told.

_**Alex:**_ They said trading regulations.

_**Michael:**_ Yeah. Yeah. No, I'm not too sure. I'm to be honest.

_**Alex:**_ Uh, here's one. What if Monero were to become illegal?

_**Michael:**_ Yeah. Well, you know, well, firstly, I don't think it matters. That's the actual reason why we build these protocols, right? But in a sense it already is, uh, at least maybe not literally, but in a roundabout way it kind of is - so they've obviously banned it from many exchanges around the world, including where I am here in Australia - well, it's actually not bad. The regulations they implement make it essentially banned, like essentially shadow banned. So what they do is they make the, at least here in Australia, they make the exchange report on, you know, where the money's gone and where it's going after that. Obviously with Monero, you can't track where it's going after that. So in that essence, they make it illegal. But where there's a will, there's a way. I mean, there's still non KYC exchanges. There's still crypto to crypto exchanges that are you could lie or whatever about your jurisdiction. They will never, I don't think they, Alex, it doesn't matter if they make it illegal. That's actually why we build these things. At the end of the day, they're gonna wanna make it illegal. They're gonna want to attack anything that goes against their current power system. Yeah, so it doesn't matter because if I still send a transaction, it gets to whoever I'm sending it to. And that's all that matters at the end of the day.

_**Alex:**_ All right, if we don't have any more questions, I think we need to get right over to the next speaker because all the power outages put us behind a little bit. Thank you so much for speaking. That was great.

_**Michael:**_ Hey, thanks so much, man. I appreciate it. The talk went a little bit quicker than I expected, but I appreciate the time, and it's 3.30 in the morning in my time, so I'm gonna hit the hay.

_**Alex:**_ All right, thanks again.

_**Michael:**_ Perfect, thanks guys.

_**Alex:**_ Yeah, have a good night.
