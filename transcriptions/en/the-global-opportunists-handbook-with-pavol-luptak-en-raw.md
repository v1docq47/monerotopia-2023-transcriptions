_**Doug:**_ We got Pavol coming up next - along the same lines of opting out with perhaps even more some specific things you can do, ways you can use technology, kind of tricks of the trade, how you could actually start to opt out. Pavol, take it away, man.

_**Pavol:**_ Thanks a lot for the introduction. Good evening. So my name is Pavol. Before I start, maybe I should follow the previous presentation. I'm really impressed with the idea of Freedom Cells. Last year, I was contacted by some people from Portugal running Freedom Cells. And maybe I should promote a project which is pretty similar, like Freedom Cells, and it's called Paralelni Polis. Who knows Paralelni Polis? Raise your hand.

Okay, so maybe you should know that like many years ago, almost eight or nine years ago, in Czech Republic in Prague with Jurai - this is the right 10 years, oh, it's even 10 years - so 10 years ago we started a project with the name Paralelni Polis. And we were like a crypto anarchist. We were really influenced by the movement of Tymothy C. May.

At the same time, like 10 years ago, we revealed a philosophy of one of the famous Czech philosopher Vaclav Benda. And Vaclav Benda was the member of the Charter 77, which was like a dissident organization in Czechoslovakia during the 70s. In Czechoslovakia during the 70s, last century, we had a totalitarian communist regime. And it was communist regime in Soviet Union and in many other countries, and we used to call this this period of Czechoslovakia to be normalization.

And in that time, it was really difficult, almost impossible to create the system, make the revolution, to make the strike. So these fields are for Vaclav Bender who was originally like mathematician. He wrote a very crucial document which is called "Paralelni Polis Manifesto". And in this document, Polis Manifesto, we basically declared that we are not able to make political change. And that's also what is just like really valid in these days. Personally I don't believe in any political change. Because, for example, in that time we don't see it possible - there were secret agents. We call them the StB, which was like the Czechoslovakian version of KGB. So in that time, nobody could trust no one, because the whole society was infiltrated by agents.

So this guy was thinking: "Hey, let's make parallel society. Let's make parallel society out of the government. Let's make parallel culture. Let's make parallel education. Let's make parallel free markets." So this guy, almost 50 years ago, 45 years ago predicted the possibility of a real society. And we were so impressed by this philosopher that we realized that thanks to technologies, especially cryptocurrency like Monero, now finally in these days, we can embrace all this technology and make this parallel society technically feasible. That was one of the main reasons why we decided to start with Paralelni Polis in Prague, and later in Bratislava, later in Kosice. And we also started like 10 years ago, we started to organize the biggest cryptoanarchist conference, which is called HCPP, which takes place every year right now in Prague.

So this is just the beginning, but you should know that there are many other movements to free themselves, like Paralelni Polis, and all of us, or most of us, are like anarchists, cryptoarchists, agorists - we really believe in free markets, and we really believe that our life is just too short to change the system globally, and we should dedicate all our free time, or all our life to build a society with the same mighty people, or similar mighty people, and that's what we're just doing, and that's why we are here, basically.

So this was just an introduction with something similar. Another important crucial thing, what I believe is that for me and for most of you, the final goal is freedom. And me personally, I consider cryptocurrencies, especially Monero, as a great liberation tool. For me, I started to use cryptocurrencies because cryptocurrencies, and especially Monero, was for me like a liberation tool. And now, what does it mean liberation tool?

Liberation tool means that not only that nobody can seize or can steal your cryptocurrencies, but thanks to cryptocurrencies, thanks to Monero, you can be global, you can use it globally - for example, now I paid something with Monero - and you can be flexible. So thanks to cryptocurrencies, you can achieve these two very important things, flexibility and being global. And when you realize that you can be flexible and you can be global, you realize that usually it doesn't make sense to receive services from local providers, for example, from in your specific region, in your specific country. And you realize that maybe it's a high time to decentralize different parts of your life, different countries.

So, and that's the main topic of my presentation. So I define the term, we just call "global opportunism". It's a bit provocative, I like it. But global opportunism basically means that you basically find the best countries, for example, for residency, the best country for healthcare system, the best country where you want to live, where you want to spend crypto. If you still use bank accounts, you can choose the country which didn't sign CRS, it's called Common Reporting Standards, but a more private, privacy-focused bank account.

So, and usually there is such options. So, me personally, when I embraced cryptocurrencies almost 10 years ago, it was basically start for me to realize that I can decentralize my life to different countries from personal perspective, but also from my company perspective. So basically I analyze the best countries where to create, for example, offshore company. I became the permanent resident of Paraguay and Panama. At the same time I would like to be like a permanent resident of Uruguay. I stopped being a resident of the European Union. The European Union is one of the biggest not only tax but also regulation hell. I'm still a citizen of Europe. So basically this is the best combination if you can, you're a citizen of for example European Union or the US and at the same time you have the residency for example in Panama or in Paraguay just because these countries, they have more for tax system. We just call it territorial; taxation system. What basically means you have to pay taxes only from your local income or your worldwide income.

So basically, despite the fact that we can see around us that the […] dystopian system is rising, we also have so great opportunities to decentralize our different aspects of our lives to different countries and especially thanks to crypto like Monero we can be really flexible and global and maybe this is just a go with my presentation. Yeah, maybe just next slide? Okay, you probably know Flag Theory? In Español, Teoria de Banderas. It means you decentralize your life, personal and economic life to many countries. Next slide.

This is how I did it personally. So you can see that my tax residence in Paraguay, which is great, so if I don't need to pay taxes from any income out of Paraguay. For doing business, I use a Wyoming company in the US. You should know that the US is the biggest tax hell if you are a US citizen, and the biggest tax paradise if you are a non-US citizen doing business quickly out of the US. I still use the bank accounts, but I decided to use my bank accounts in the non CRS, privacy oriented country like Georgia for example or Paraguay. I still use some crypto cards so you can check like one cool feature of Xapo is that you can make KYC as a permanent tax resident which is really practical because… oh… and that's all. Okay. I have the global health insurance in the US. I use the benefits of health tourists, for example, in different countries.

_Do you love coffee and Monero as much as we do? Consider making gratuitas.org your daily cup. Pay with Monero for premium fresh beans, and if you like what you taste, send a digital cash tip directly to the Guatemalan farmers that made it possible. Proceeds help us grow this channel. Gratuitas and Monero._

_**Pavol:**_ Next slide, please. You have this slide, okay, next slide. Yeah, so for example, I'm going to specify or to describe my personal scenario and like potentially very economically and financially very straightforward sort.

So I'm the permanent tax resident of Paraguay. So basically I'm traveling all the time. I don't stay in any country more than six months except for Paraguay which means I don't have any central interest out of Paraguay. I use US LLC company for doing business out of the US. So I have strictly non-US customer doing business out of the US, which means that tax duty of the US company is through the mechanism, which is called "path through", it's transformed to your tax residency of the owners of this company to Paraguay. In this situation, these taxes are… you don't need in this situation, you don't need to declare or pay taxes.

I prefer using Monero for all payments. One important information for you should know when you use Monero is that it's quite easy to create offshore company anywhere you want. The biggest problem is not to create the offshore company, the biggest problem is to open bank accounts for this company.

For example, you can quite easily create Panamanian company. But opening a bank account for your Panamanian company is almost impossible. Trust me, you know, like the banking industry in Panama is the most regulated. So if you are able to survive or stay out of the traditional, like a fiat system, traditional banking industry, and you use your offshore company with Monero, the number of your possibilities where you can create the company or where you can do business, significantly increases. So I strongly recommend you not to use bank accounts, if you can afford it. Not to use bank accounts and then you can really create the company in any offshore country you want and save bureaucracy, save taxes. Also you can use crypto cards, for example. And if you really need the bank you should check the country's which you need not sign CRS like Georgia, for example, or Paraguay. Next slide, please.

One important information, digital nomad life or the life of global opportunist is probably not for everybody. If freedom is important in your life, being global and flexible may be the best way to fulfill it. So just do it and that's the message of my presentation. Thank you a lot.

_**Doug:**_ All right, all right. Thank you so much, man. That was fantastic. We can take maybe like one question. We could do one question.

_**Pavol:**_ Oh, okay. I did personal… recently I made my personal website which is called opportunist.global, it's easy, and then I have a company that helps people to opt out of the system and its name is also easy to remember, it's called liberation.travel. That's all.

_**Question:**_ For people who are not exercising this for various reasons, he's dubbed since he's so public, like he's got family where he lives, he stays closest. What can we do to facilitate other people in ease of transition? So basically what can people who are not living globally do to strengthen this as an opportunity for others who choose to exercise it?

_**Pavol:**_ Even if you're staying at one place and in this situation, you don't have like a tax benefit of like digital nomads for all you are the US citizens, another option. So basically like a slave. You can still try to opt out of the system in many different areas, like speaker before me mentioned. So especially you can keep your privacy — you can use Monero, you can be out of the monetary system. Still you can use benefits of health tourism, for example, or global health insurance. So there are many options, not tax benefits, but there are many other options. You can still use offshore companies, for example, not because of taxes, but because of like rural crossing, for example.

_**Doug:**_ I saw, I think it's Buddy who had a question. There's just hands, shut up. I don't want to… no, let body speak.

_**Question:**_ Thanks, I appreciate that. My question was about after the Panama Papers and OECD, the Organization for the Economic Cooperation Development, have you had a hard time doing corporate structure like BVI different? As one example, BVI is like, has all these requirements to operate properly. Have you found it more difficult to operate corporations after the Panama Papers and OECD reforms that have happened lately?

_**Doug:**_ Wow, very good question.

_**Pavol:**_ Very good question. Panama papers, especially for Panama, was like a huge repetition scandal for the whole of Panama. And also it was an excuse for big countries, especially the US and France, to force other countries to sign CRS. So most offshore countries or Caribbean countries including Panama including —what country did you mention?

[…]:

I was talking about BVI.

_**Pavol:**_ I think even BVI was forced to sign CRS, like in most countries. So basically it means, like CRS means bath of financial privacy, because these countries, if you open the bank account as a foreigner, they have to do an automatic reporting to your home countries. So thanks to Panama Papers, many countries, or it was used as an excuse, they were forced to sign CRS. And then many people who had their companies, for example, in Panama or BVI, they moved their company, where? To the US, of course. That's really important to say, because the US, forced the other countries to sign CRS, but the US never signed CRS. That's all.

So for example, it means if you are like a European citizen and you open bank account in the US, you have like a bit of privacy like Panama, for example. Question.

_**Doug:**_ Who had a question? All right, last question. Urai.

_**Urai:**_ I just want to add something, because it seems that this lifestyle is for hippies who live with the backpack and don't have families, so many of us actually have families. We also do business. Pavol is a great entrepreneur. I have a luck of starting some companies and nonprofits with him. So he employs people, he's actually a really good businessman.

So I just wanted to say that if you keep your eyes open and if you go like area of your life, you know, opt out children of school, see where it's best doing business, see where it's best to keep your money and so on. So don't focus in, you know, one country that will solve your problem comparing governments is like comparing tapeworms. You don't do that. So you're not looking for the best country. You're looking for solving your problems in life. So talk to Pavol. He's really, he lives this and give you a more detailed answer after I think.

_**Doug:**_ Fantastic.

_**Pavol:**_ Maybe I should add that even if you live inside of the US, you can still make some kind of decentralization and choose better space for something else. Even if you live inside of the US, you can decentralize your life and your activists to many different US states, and you'll get better advantage, for example.

_**Doug:**_ All right, we're going to wrap it up. Thank you so much, Pavol. Greatly appreciate it.
