_**A Q&A on the History of CryptoNote**_

[https://youtu.be/ONSvOzB407c](https://youtu.be/ONSvOzB407c)

---

_**Doug:**_ Hi guys, this is Andrey, who’s from Zano project. He is one of the guys who created the first implementation of CryptoNote. The Monero is based on CryptoNote protocol. Bitcoin is based on a Bitcoin protocol. It was invented a few years after Monero, after Bitcoin was released, and it was invented, created in response to Bitcoin, trying to fix Bitcoin fungibility problems, trying to add privacy for a cryptocurrency. And Andrey was keeping to that, he was one trying to do that. And you are going to tell about your background, may be about early days of CryptoNote a little bit, you know, the project you’re working on today, and then we’ll go into a Q&A. So good.

_**Andrey:**_ Ok, do everybody hear me? Ok, so I’ll try to get this part short. So I was working in a anti-malware industry for eight years, and then I got involved in some problems with malware case with Microsoft. I got into the wide industries, I was trying to find something else for myself. I got invited FinTech project, which was like  close to CryptoNote, and I was working there. And I had to left of the project because I had a disagreement with the way it should be running and launched. and then I left, I started my own project — Blueberry. And then at some point I decided that I have to rewrite the code turn it into a proof of stake, and then I started to find the partners to work with people, and we founded Zano and then… that’s it. Then we work with Zano. Yeah that’s pretty much… okay.

_**Doug:**_ Well so tell us a little bit more about the early days of CryptoNote … like what was going on that time, give us some intimate, so how you got started with CryptoNote, how it happened, how did you get involved in the project? Did you also have to develop it?

_**Andrey:**_ In the early days of protocol there was a guy called Nicholas van Saberhagen. He’s a real brain behind the project. He invented the protocol, invented most of the things. And he wrote the paper. There was another people working together with him, but Nicolas was the guy. What else I can tell about to you? I don’t know. … It’s been a few guys in the team — there was the manager, there was a another cryptographer guy, there was also another developer, it was a really exciting time for me, because when I was involved in this, I first faced the crypto, they educated me — what it is, how it’s work, and I never faced such a challenging project, I never faced such sophisticated technology, so it took some time for me to learn stuff, to figure out how the core supposed to work, develop supposed to work. And yeah, it was a really exciting for me, was a really big excitement.

That’s it.I don’t know. It’s just they invited me on the interview at some point, some of our mutual friends connected us, and as I know when I came to interview I made a cryptographer guys, Nicholas and another guy, they freaked out, because I didn’t like the way they put the network stuff, so they freak out about this, they checked my Linkedin profile, and they didn’t like it for some reason. But after sometime we really get to work together.

So I don’t know why me, but as far as I know, that’s been three teams before I came to the project. There were other teams that tried to implement this thing, but they couldn’t make it. So the founders are required the whole team and took the new people. Well, probably it worked, because I had really a lot of background in the networking, including decentralizing networking, implementing my own protocols, also I’ve been working on a C++ for a long time, so yeah, I think they decided it’s gonna be a good fit.

_**Doug:**_ Awesome, awesome. So if you here in the audience have a question… anybody’s got a question? If you can, come on, come on up, try to bring the mic to you if you guys can come down the aisle, if you come down the aisle over here. Ok, go for it.

_**Audience:**_ So I have two questions. Sorry to be a hog but I would like your opinion on: number one — what’s the biggest threat to the privacy and security of crypto today, and number two — what’s the biggest obstacle to adoption today?

_**Andrey:**_ I think the biggest threat to privacy as a technology in a blockchain industry, if you do speak about blockchain industry, first of all we, I don’t know how to say this, it’s a lot of things. I think the problem is that a lot of people are not actually understand and underestimate the importance of privacy, and when they see projects, like DeFi projects or the blockchain Ethereum based giants — it’s much more usable, it’s more functions, you have a lot of staff there, so they think it’s just more suitable, and that’s why a lot of people using this and just for some reason ignore the privacy. I think this that’s the problem, and I like that people mostly try to educate and bring the importance of their privacy. It’s one of the reasons and one of the problems.

The second problem is — in the privacy focus blockchains from technical perspective — everything is a way more complicated. It’s like if you compare from technology perspective blockchains like the Bitcoin or Ethereum, I’m not saying that Ethereum is simple, but when it comes to the privacy, everything became so complicated, and it used modern mass to implement this. And the problem is that to make sure that this is private, to make sure this is reliable. You need some time, you need a lot of eyes looking into this, and I think that some small projects, like ours for example, we have a lack of attention and lack of reviewers, and this also … in privacy and the availability of the privacy projects. But this is a really important stuff. And I liked it that Monero has a really big community of developers and researchers, and that’s what makes Monero strong that you have a lot of eyes looking into the technology, into the papers, into the source code. So this is very important.

The second was… what was? Adoption. Well, if you look at them most of the privacy focused projects, it has, a I would say, it has a lack of user experience, lack of usability. So average user who come from NFT or DeFi or something, they face the challenge, they need to know a lot of stuff, they need to wait for a long time also because of the complexity of technology, and that’s the problem that people have to make it not in a convenient way. I would say this plays a big role.

I also think another problem is that some of the exchanges are hesitate to list privacy projects for the only reason — because they have a regulations after them for that in some countries. Also for a privacy project the problem is that you cannot see how much … interpolation because we don’t have a UTXO. So even if the blockchain is like hacked you probably won’t be able to say it. So someone just damp on the price, so this is also quite a risky stuff. Yeah, that’s it.

_**Doug:**_ Ok so please point to me to somebody else. Guys, everybody in the audience can just try to be as quiet as you can. Fix it unless you’re asking a question, until set it well. Who wants to remain off camera, by the way, you don’t have to go on camera to be to ask a question. That’d be very “un-Monero” like.

_**Audience:**_ Hi, I actually remember the launch of Blueberry. So you were very early. So I actually want to know if you have any insights in the Bytecoin instamine thing, and what’s happened there? I mean there were weird loops in the CryptoNight mining code and stuff like that, which seems that it was done deliberately to give an advantage to the original Bytecoin developers.

_**Doug:**_ Ok, This time please take that one.

_**Andrey:**_ The question is if I knew about the way they launched Bytecoin? Yeah, of course I know. If you apologize, I cannot speak a lot about this topic, because I had agreement with my boss when I was working for personal, working on that. I’m not sharing details of the how was done, but I can say that I didn’t like it. I love the project, I lost my bonus, I had a quite a big stake in a Bytecoin, but I quit because I didn’t like the way it launched. I didn’t see the future for this project, the way it launched, and I just I didn’t want to be part of this. That’s what I can definitely share, but I don’t think even if I told, you would know something new. Everything is clear, everything is clean. Internet is a quite open space — you can see what was happened, what was the difficulty, what was the stuff. So that’s it pretty much. I mean for any other insights you should ask a particularly.

I can say actually more to this, I know that in the Monero community very negative perception of CryptoNote history and I understand why. You have your own reasons for that. But you should understand, it’s been a lot of drama for us, for the team and scientists, because the team, the technical team, was against this, no one liked this. Most of the original team left after. You can see it from the code base you, see that code base changed totally — they have a different coding, style they did it with a poor quality, because they changed the team, everything. So it’s been a lot of stress for us too, because we put so much effort into creating this. And for me I was really excited, I was really enjoying work with Nicholas. Ye taught me a lot of stuff. It was like a New York University.

_**Doug:**_ Please, stop for one second. Let’s wait until signs pass.

_**Andrey:**_ So, yeah. It’s just been a lot of drama for us too, and for those people who quit. That’s it.

_**Doug:**_ Do you have more mike running, one more microphone? Maybe turn that one on?

_**Andrey:**_ For the police?

_**Doug:**_ All right, how’s this? This is good? Ok. I know one of the criticisms or not criticisms, but things that people point out, it was that the Monero code itself was kind of sloppy in the early days. That it was hard to follow, it wasn’t easy for people to build upon it. Any comments on that?

_**Andrey:**_ Well, it was sloppy because there were things that broken hash function that was made another that it was supposed to be, or even the architecture of the code base.

_**Doug:**_ You mean the documentation is…

_**Andrey:**_ That’s me to blame. That’s me to blame, yeah. I don’t make a lot of comments, and you can see it in a code data bases. Yeah, shame on me. But it wasn’t made intentionally actually, and we followed, for instance, I have a… there’s a few books and they give you a code style recommendation, like Alexandria code or modern C++ design, and we just followed this books, and that I assume that people can read this if there’s no design patterns, if they know how like normally it’s done. And if you’ve seen for example Bitcoin or the base, it’s written a little bit on the old style, C style, and we use a modern C++, a lot of templates, different architectures. I think maybe some of our bitcoiners had the difficulties to read this database, because it’s all the different. But I believe, the time showed that the architecture was chosen really great, and the code base created was really great, because obviously Monero still use this code base and I just improve it.

_**Doug:**_ All right as you see we’re getting some juicy answers here, guys. You just have to ask the right questions. Jurai, you have got some good questions? No? No, he’s just keeping his mouth shut as well as his wallet. We got a question over here. Ok, we’re gonna switch mics, because that one is longer. What’s that? I hear somebody saying something. We got a question over here. Make it juicy. That’s controversial.

_**Audience:**_ No, no, I just follow up. Is there any plans to build some, for example, some new documentation of CryptoNote or in the case of Zano, is Zano, does Zano will have like a better documentation or is there any plans for them?

_**Andrey:**_ Yeah, we should have to, because now we are building a platform, we’re trying to get the other developers using Zano, because we can offer them to create a confidential assets, so they can use it. Not as universal, not as flexible as DeFi, but still we can offer something that…

_**Audience:**_ Definitely you should work on the code base?

_**Andrey:**_ Yeah, of course but it’s gonna be more documentation of the API and maybe transactional architecture. But I don’t think we’ll be putting more comments in the code base, only except maybe some tricky places, questionable places, where we do the comment if we think this need to be optimized, but I still believe that I experienced developer can see the code, can read the code from the way the variables or function name, he can read the idea what’s going on there. So I mean we don’t have, if we would be like a big company with a lot of people, a lot of hands, of course, we would do the nice documentation. But also I think Monero also don’t do a lot of documentation last days, like last, because they started to document and put a lot of documentation on the source code to the first years, probably because like they wanted to figure out how everything works. But from what I saw last code, it’s not that much documented. I think they come to the same conclusion that if you use the same coder style you, if you use  the same like we have a code style roots, how the code should be done, if you use the same coder style everywhere, you can easily read and see the patterns, see the algorithms and stuff like that.

_**Audience:**_ And I have another question. So what did you think about other privacy projects and the different approaches or improvements that have been on CryptoNote for example Firo, Monero, Spark or Seraphis, or ZCash even? What are your thoughts on that, and what are the strengths that you see in CryptoNote to continue to improve on it?

_**Andrey:**_ Unfortunately, because we focus too much on our code base and our research, we don’t have a lot of time to see what other projects doing, and I’m not really following everything that happens in the industry. But we know that Firo is doing amazing stuff, and we trying to work or have some conversation with them, and they have a really strong developers, of course, and Monero has the biggest developers and researchers community. And I think that’s the strong point that Monero have a huge community of researches. It’s amazing. But I cannot say specifically, I know that the Firo is doing confidential assets also, that’s amazing, that’s exciting, and we’re probably gonna share our thoughts about this and exchange some experience, and maybe we’ll come up to some general standards for this, something like not universality but from privacy, but I cannot say specifically.

_**Doug:**_ Where do you see this all heading, Andrey? I mean so you have all these competing cryptos, and then in particular you have a lot of coins competing in the privacy sector, competing to be the main digital cash, utility. How do you see things working out? How do you see the ecosystem? Is it going to consolidate among a few players, is there going to be one digital cash protocol that will be used for those purposes? What’s your opinion on that?

_**Andrey:**_ I think it’s never gonna be one protocol for many reasons, but I believe the first thing I think and in the crypto industry and especially in privacy area, it has some sort of really wild conditions, very toxic conditions, and this creates great environment for evolution. And that’s make technologies stronger, because if you have some regulations, some rules, then it’s based on this. But if you have a “Wild West”, if you created a mistake and everybody can hack your project and turn the market capital zero in a one single shots, that’s rude, it’s like cruel, but that’s a great and healthy environment to create some really solid technologies. And I think it’s gonna be more and more solutions that connect different blockchain projects between each other, and it’s maybe will be something like a network of connected, like a network, the huge super network of domains of different projects. That’s how it worked in the DeFi right now, in Ethereum. Ethereum networks are getting connected with a bridge, custodial bridge, some custodial bridge — it’s not safe, I mean, I know it’s not the best way, but still they tend to connect to each other, and that’s I think that’s gonna happen between privacy project, and the privacy project will be connected to other projects.

_**Doug:**_ All right. Ok, more questions? Come on up, I can only go so far.

_**Audience:**_ Hello.

_**Andrey:**_ Hi.

_**Audience:**_ So I’ve heard that in the early days of CryptoNote and Monero that there was let’s say inefficient mining software. And if you knew how to exploit this inefficient mining software, then you could actually mine much more efficiently than everyone else. I think it was even Fluffypony who questioned if this might have been done intentionally. So I was wondering if you have any insight or opinion into this mining software,m which was inefficient.

_**Andrey:**_ Well, this was not official, is it supposed to be, it’s true, and yeah, it is what it is. I don’t like this, but also I can say that after it got optimized, then it’s got optimize it more and more that like no one even expected this it could be optimized that fast. But in original code base it was not as supposed to be definitely. Of course. It’s obvious and no one in the team liked this. That was the business decision, that’s it.

_**Doug:**_ Great question, great. Any other follow-up questions to that? No, ok. How long was it not optimized for what? Can you give us some insight into that?

_**Andrey:**_ How long?

_**Doug:**_ Yeah like how long did it take before it was realized that there was this kind of advantage that people had with mining, just because people didn’t take the time to realize that things were optimized.

_**Andrey:**_ Figure out by who?

_**Doug:**_ I’m asking, there was a period of time, where there was an advantage for those who are aware of this. I would just saying for how long did that happen before it was realized?_

**Andrey:**_ I think it was realized by Monero community after, I don’t know exact, but at some point in a few weeks everyone realized that it’s possible to optimize miner, and it was not as it’s supposed to be. I think it was a few weeks.

_**Doug:**_ Ok, go ahead.

_**Audience:**_ I don’t want to trade on your commitment to confidentiality with your former employer, but I can’t resist asking some general questions about that early team, it’s really amazing that you were there at the time. And I’m wondering about the general spirit of the team. These guys, you know, Nicholas and I guess thankful_for_today, you and other developers were people like did they think a lot of themselves, is what they were doing, or were they humble. I mean clearly they were technically talented, but were they idealistic, did they think they were doing this for the greater good, or were they focused on more on making money? I just wanted the general spirit of the team at that time.

_**Andrey:**_ First of all I can say about Nicholas, he is a very humble person, absolutely, literally, he was not faking that he’s a humble person. And he was helping me when I was launching Blueberry, he was helping me with a Zano stuff. And I was literally pushed him to take the money, because we had some funds, and he didn’t want to take it, he was saying: “I don’t need anything, I’m just happy to help you”. Nicholas is a really amazing person — as a friend, as a scientist. He is very humble. He never wanted anything for him, he never wanted to be… I invited him to this event, even to come incognito, but he didn’t want to. And I wanted him many times, I offered him to come to the spot…

_**Doug:**_ He is here among us right now? Is Nicholas hanging along? Just wait. Wink. Just give us a wink.

_**Andrey:**_ Yeah, and the rest of the team — I’m not the spiritual. When I was hired, I was hired as a developer, I knew nothing about open source culture, I knew nothing about crypto stuff, I was just a good C++ developer with a great network background. That’s what I’ve been. They just bought me, they give good salary, above the market. and said: “Do this stuff”. And when I was in the team, when I was working, Nicholas and the other guy, they taught me what is the open source community, why crypto is open source, how they operate, why it’s not possible to take control over the crypto because of the open source community they do the fourth. They educated me a lot of stuff, and that’s where I became like a more not idealistic, but I learned it the way it’s supposed to be, learned the way the crypto operates. So the cryptocurrency is not a technology, not only technology, it’s also a spirit, it’s also an approach, it’s a visionary of how it’s supposed to be open transparent technology, right? So this thing I learned from them.

But when I came, I was just a typical corporate developer, was just selling myself, that’s it. And the other guys, there was other guy, the product, he was really great, and he was really has a good understanding how open source community works, what are the cryptocurrency, why are they more existent another way. So he knew it pretty much. That’s one of the reasons he also didn’t like what happened at the end of the project, when we were launching. Because when we were working on the project, we didn’t know that it’s going to be this way. We just had the idea how it’s going to be launched, open fair launch…

_**Audience:**_ And Nicholas didn’t know that either?

_**Andrey:**_ No, nobody know. And at some point we started to get a few testnets launched. The first testnet collapsed, the second collapsed, and after a few attempts we launched the first testnet in the office. And then there was another few launches done, and then it’s turned out that it’s working. And then at that point, I would say call it the business team, saw that: “Oh, that’s actually working now. This attempt is working”, because n it wasn’t the first team. And they started to think, I think, started to think, how to make more money or whatever they were thinking about. And then they come up with not smart decisions, and then we all became really sad about them. It is what it is.

_**Audience:**_ Were there any early … warning signs about those that added that into the code that disappointed? I mean were they were they different than the others?

_**Andrey:**_ No but we had a few conversations about like how it’s supposed to be, what would be the best way to launch it. But no one would expect these things, and even if he knew, for example, the choice, for example, what I would have is with the project, so they shut down everything and start a new team, launch it again, and do their own thing. So I really wanted technology to come out, to be public, so I just make it to the end. That’s it.

_**Doug:**_ Thank you. And now it’s getting juicy, this is great, thank you, Andrey. Thank you for being so genuine up here by the way this is fantastic. So a lot of people like to say, you know, Nicholas van Saberhagen — NS,  Satoshi Nakamoto — SN, is there any truth to this theory that some of the people who were involved in Bitcoin, maybe some of the same people…

_**Andrey:**_ No he’s just a very talented mathematician, I mean, he’s a really great person. He was teaching the kids for free, the mass, he was teaching because he wanted the popularization of mathematics and stuff like that. He’s like amazing person.

_**Doug:**_ Was he into Bitcoin as well?

_**Andrey:**_ A?

_**Doug:**_ Was he into Bitcoin as well? Nicholas van Saberhagen?

_**Andrey:**_ You mean, was he related into development, or he was related into holding Bitcoins?

_**Doug:**_ I guess, was he related to the development, I think I kind of already asked that, and then a second question if not — was he just, you know, very much into Bitcoin, into…

_**Andrey:**_ As a scientist, and it’s not a programmer, but it’s a scientist, yeah, he was really interested in this stuff for quite some time before the project.

_**Doug:**_ But he never worked on Bitcoin as far as I know.

_**Andrey:**_ No, no. He has no connection to Bitcoin or anything. But he had a quite clear understanding what they’re doing, quite clear. He was quite great with are not what should be done, and we were reading the papers for Gregory Maxwell, for example, he had a list of what I would do if I do this otherwise, and other notes. So we had all this together and use it for the creating new code base.

_**Doug:**_ Awesome. Another question.

_**Audience:**_ Hi! So I think Bitcoin was like a total scam, that’s what everybody’s kind of getting at here, that they like pre-mined 80 percent of the coins or whatever, and so I was just curious what’s your opinion on how important a fair launch is for a coin, and what you see is like for any kind of cryptocurrency where you have a company or an organization taking a few percent or a few tens of percent, like do you think that puts an upper bound on how widely used it can ever become, because the most successful coin is Bitcoin, and the most successful privacy coin is Monero, and they both had quote-unquote fair launch, right. So like how do you feel about like the potential…?

_**Andrey:**_ Yeah, that’s a great question actually, thank you for that. I can tell you that you can see from the timeline how the perception of fair or not fair launch was changing. When I was launching the first project back to 2014, Blueberry, it’s considered to be a scam. If you do a premine, and even little premine is considered to be a scam, and it’s one of the reasons I created only one percent of the dev from cut, I mean one percent of the block rewards cut, and that was a mistake, because the project died because of lack of finance. And also it’s wrong to compare other crypto projects with the Bitcoin, because it’s none of other blockchains are comparable. It’s very different. They have a different history for many, many, many reasons. And the history that had a Bitcoin no other crypto project will ever have. It’s just different.

And also for Monero it’s not the best example, because Monero didn’t build technology from the on the ground. I mean, I know this I maybe get a lot of hate from this, but Monero was a copy/paste based fork with the one line changed, and that’s how they started, right? So because by this time there was no real privacy project existed in the area, this new technology let consolidate all privacy minded people around the project. And the first Monero improvements did a great job to consolidate these people. That was amazing great job and that’s really great. But it’s a wrong example, because to build the technology itself you need to invest some money, like that’s also a risk when you invest, you can lose the money because technology can be broken. so everyone who invests actually expect to get paid back. So I think Monero is great that you have a donators, but I think you also faced the problem of lack of funding, because you don’t have a premine. And I think maybe at some point in the future you decide to try to rethink this. But look at this right now, when you see the other projects on the market, other projects that build closure, when you see the project is the packed with money, the project that has a lot of good developers, good researchers, they can build a better technology. And then they make money from this, they can invest huge amounts of money in marketing, and then they take over.

So perception of the fair launch shifted right now. It’s very different. And for me I really think fairness and unfairness is not related of the amount of the how much money you do premine. The fair launch is the transparent launch. Fair launch is when you say openly and transparent what you do for the premine, what you do for the dev fund, what you do the bounties and stuff like that. And then market decide if your worth attention, worth the money that you ask for the coins or not. That’s the fair launch. And that’s different things - a business model and the fair launch. Fair launch is that you shouldn’t lie to other people. That’s my perception of fair launch.

_**Doug:**_ Ok, ok. Yeah, I think in Monero people would say, you know, one of the advantages is to be develop a community that’s working on it, is really in it for the passion, right, for this kind of cypherpunk drive to create digital cash, and that’s really what motivates them. Not that they don’t need to make money or don’t want to make money, but that’s really the motivating, driving factor that’s driving the community, that’s getting people to develop and contribute.

_**Andrey:**_ Yeah it’s a good point, but from other perspective with this approach you see a lot of passionate people who contribute on the part-time basis. They have a real job and they spend few hours a day to contribute, maybe a few days a week, and that’s the project, like the crypto project, I think, I believe, it requires like a full-time attention. You should dedicate yourself to this and live inside this house all the time like Paul, for example, doing. He has no life beside this, of course.

_**Doug:**_ I think we’ll hear from Paul on Sunday, right?

_**Andrey:**_ Yeah, yeah, he’ll be speaking. So that’s you think is a great, and I wish we would have a contributors who are passionate about the privacy, about technology, but we faced a lot of people who like to be on the stage, like to be around, like to contribute something, but not much people who are ready to dedicate themselves for full time without the payment, because they have to feed the family, they have to buy stuff. And that’s how a lot of actually not bad, good projects died in 2014, 2015, 2016. Every year in the market projects are dying.

_**Doug:**_ Yeah, we should say Monero is funded, it’s just for listening for those who may not know, well. it’s just there is no dev tax, right. So the funding comes from contributions that the Monero community makes to developers or anybody that’s working on the project that they think deserves funding. And some of those is basically funding developers full-time to do what they do.

_**Andrey:**_ Can I, one least, one little thing, because we also faced this, we tried to raise money from the whales of our project. The problem is that this, you know, the commonwealth strategy, so the people, some people are agree to donate money, but they agree if other also donate. And if the other people are not donating, they also don’t want donate them, because why would I sponsor everything and other people benefit from this? We face it a lot. And even if you have a generous people in your communities, they also asking themselves, is it fair that they pay from their money and others are not paying. And that’s the problem that we faced with finding money from the community.

_**Doug:**_ Yes. The Sherman’s waiting patiently, but I’ll give the viewers at home the opportunity to ask a question. I want to throw one of the questions up here. “Question for Andrey: Is there any vetting or security check for the development team? If not — why not? If yes — what is the objective and what is the process?” I assume they’re referring to Zano. So Is there any vetting or security check for the development team? If not — why not? If yes — what is the objective and what is the process? It’s very exact question.

_**Andrey:**_ What is it? Security chat?

_**Doug:**_ Is there any vetting or security check for the development team? Let’s get to the next question if you’re not really get it.

_**Andrey:**_ A background check for who, for the team?

_**Doug:**_ Those that are working on Zano.

_**Andrey:**_ I mean we are a really small team. That’s me and Paul, we do the core development. Pavel is doing the product stuff and also development. So we know each other for ages, like really for ages. I don’t even have any idea. This is my background check. We started to work with Paul I think like eight years ago, something like that. And the first thing he started to do, all the core tests, I asked him to implement the core tests. That’s actually a very important part of the project. And I would suggest Monero to implement more core tests, because units tests are… that’s what saved our ass in case of trouble. So the first he started to work with little things, little by little, but then he got involved more and more, and more, and then now he is a the smartest guy in the team.

_**Doug:**_ Another question: “What is Andrey’s opinion of the current Monero dynamic block size algorithm, and how it has changed since CryptoNote?” So comments on Monero’s dynamic block size.

_**Andrey:**_ We never had any problems with this, maybe because we are not that big project. But I can imagine potential problem with its, because the size of the block is not a real problem for the most of the projects in CryptoNote based too, because most of the problem was the checking signatures — that’s the bottleneck. So that’s where actually this size limitation used to limit the amount of transaction in the block, so we don’t get stuck on the heavy transactions, but I don’t think we never face it is a this is a big problem, but I expect the bottleneck may be in the amount of transactions and the ring signatures.

_**Doug:**_ Ok, ok. Some other question?

_**Audience:**_ Hi, Andrey. Yeah,  I know you have access to this question, but some people maybe don’t know that, so… But, since you’re talking about Bitcoin and Monero, and everything else, there’s a lot of what I’ve heard in the TV and the radio a long time ago. Also they were saying the currency working to solve complex mathematic, right? Like what kind of problems, mathematical problems have been solved by crypto networks?

_**Andrey:**_ Crypto networks work for solving mathematical problems?

_**Audience:**_ Yeah, that’s what they were saying in the mass media long time ago.

_**Andrey:**_ Well I think the cypto networks work to just transfer money, and that’s the goal.

_**Audience:**_ That’s what it is, yeah, ok.

_**Andrey:**_ We, the engineers solve mathematical problems. We see the challenges and trying to work on this. But theoretically it could be created some blockchain project that use instead of the proof of work just some sort of algorithm that solves some mathematical or scientific problem. It’s been talks about this since very beginning. If you do check that Bitcoin Talk they started to talk about early days like 2012 they’ve been trying to come up with some project that not just waste energy but do something that is useful, for example, DNA calculations or stuff like that. But I never heard about any project that was created. Yeah, yeah, that’s a good example — Primecoin. Do they operate or no? Yeah, right, it’s a good point.

_**Audience:**_ Ok, thanks. So there’s no waste of resources on CryptoNote.

_**Andrey:**_ I don’t know, but also I’m a proof of stake person, I will be fighting for the proof of stake on the Sunday, and I don’t think proof of work has any future in cryptocurrency. I think we won’t see any proof of work projects in the 10 years.

_**Audience:**_ Yeah, thank you.

_**Andrey:**_ I’m going to have a very tough conversation on Sunday about it.

_**Doug:**_ Any other questions guys? Let’s keep this going for a little bit. Any other questions for Andrey? May be about proof, well? We’re going to kind of get into some juicy stuff. Go ahead, come on, bring it up.

_**Audience:**_ We will see the whole proof of work for proof of stake in the near decade or something. I want to say about that theory that…

_**Andrey:**_ Can you speak more loud, because we cannot hear.

_**Audience:**_ Sorry. With the incoming of the new financial system that everyone, everybody is going to retract basically the mark of the business, do you think even the government will need privacy solution like Monero to do their business like under the table? Is it just possible that they won’t fully act against it,  because they will actually need it?

_**Andrey:**_ Possible they do what?

_**Audience:**_ Do you think it’s possible that even governments will require some privacy, because supposedly if the CBDCs are going to be fully transparent, even they will need it.

_**Andrey:**_ Yeah it depends…

_**Audience:**_ …for corruption, and you know…

_**Andrey:**_ Yeah, to hide the corruption maybe. I don’t think they actually need a cryptocurrency at all yet. But it really depends from the government, if you ask me, because there is so different government in the world, different countries. For now I think, I believe that the most valuable for people, for the citizens privacy needed for us, not for the government. But maybe at some point the adoption will be that wide ,so they accept it as a standard, as a standard of the payment system. I believe it’s going to be full success at some point. But it’s going to be a really long way to this.

_**Doug:**_ All right. We got Articmine over here, but before we let him ask a question: is Raphael here, because we wanted to jump up and give the next talk? Is he in the room? All right we’ll have to go find him, or maybe we’ll have Pavel jump up. Go ahead.

_**Andrey:**_ Is it going to be proof of work question?

_**ArticMine:**_ I have a couple of questions that will got to do with two things: tail emissions and adaptive block sizes. What are your thoughts on that. I’m of the opinion that the original implementation of CryptoNote does not work, because of lack of tail emission. But I just don’t know what your thoughts

_**Andrey:**_ Sorry, tail what?

_**ArticMine:**_ Tail emission mean that your block reward will hit some minimum with how it Monero does. In CryptoNote it went to zero, and then, if I understand correctly against the Bytecoin, it was actually abandoned, adaptive block size was abandoned in Bytecoin?

_**Andrey:**_ In Bytecoin — yeah. But I’m not related…

_**ArticMine:**_ No, you don’t related, I do understand. But my question is: what’s your thoughts on this question of adaptive block sizes, tail emission and the concept in Bitcoin that fees are going to replace block reward.

_**Andrey:**_ Yeah, I think it was, I mean, it’s always tech, but it was a bad design by Satoshi. He didn’t, if you read his early comments on the Bitcoin Talk, he didn’t expect the hashrate is gonna be that crazy, he even was writing like a comments like: let’s be, let’s make a gentleman agreement and everyone will mine only one coin a pew . So he didn’t know that’s gonna be this way, and I think it was just not the perfect design. So yeah, most of the projects need to fix it, to have a block reward, because otherwise it’s not gonna cover the transaction cost, not gonna cover it. Because transactions are getting cheaper and cheaper, if you see in some Ethereum networks they having a really cheap fees, if you see in Solana, so that they go into this. So I think, I believe, transactions won’t make it.

And also the thing is that if you have a cheap like a really low block reward, you can create an alternative chain, because it comes to the difficulty. So you can probably find another vector of attack creating the empty blocks. So yeah it may be, I believe, the tail mission is the right thing to do, but it’s not from economical perspective. It’s from engineering perspective — not to get hacked. But from economical perspective, I don’t think it’s a bad thing because we get more and more coins minted, but it’s not in Zano, we don’t have a big pressure on the price, because we can make it really a small block reward, because we believe proof of stake is harder to break. That’s it.

_**ArticMine:**_ Well that’s actually gratifying to hear, because you’ll be one of the few other coins outside of Monero that actually believes in this. That’s very gratifying to hear of, you know, from my perspective. I’m really happy to hear that.

_**Andrey:**_ Sorry?

_**ArticMine:**_ I say, I’m very happy to hear that. I’m very pleased about that.

_**Andrey:**_ Yeah happy you say it.

_**ArticMine:**_ I mean this is my concern, because yeah the whole thing follows.

_**Andrey:**_ Yeah, block reward is something that securing your history. But the thing is it’s securing your history, block reward secure history a proof of work chain. But it’s not that important in proof of stake chain, because it’s not the effort to create a block, it’s not related to block reward. In proof of work it does. In proof of stake it’s not. In the proof of stake projects you can even, yeah I’m starting to speak about the proof of stake, mistakes, sorry… yeah… but in proof of stake projects you can lower tail emission, smaller and smaller, if you want.

_**ArticMine:**_ So when you then run into the same problem, because you’re not supporting the stakers.

_**Andrey:**_ We still have a part of proof of work in Zano consensus. We use proof of work and proof of stake, and that’s why we have to keep our block rewards for a reasonable amount. But as soon as we migrate to full proof of stake, if we find out the way how to overcome things like long range attacks, now we use proof of work to protect from that, but as soon we are in work on it, we will be more free on the choice. And then if we migrate to full proof of stake, then we can pick up the block reward only from economical perspective, only from the way we want the economic works.

_**ArticMine:**_ Ok, I thank you, like I said, I have serious doubts of the lack of reward to the stakers.

_**Andrey:**_ Reward for the block?

_**ArticMine:**_ Yes. I think you will not have enough fees for that. Thank you.

_**Andrey:**_ Yeah, yeah, and the thing is there’s a bunch of, for example, a bunch of coins, for example, 720 coins every day split between all the stakers who participate in staking, right? And if it’s not enough for you to quit staking, and this amount of money is split between other people, so it’s always find like a balance.

_**Doug:**_ We’re gonna do a whole panel on that, we’re going to have you on the panel. We’re gonna have you and Paul on that. But now we have to go on with the questions. koe has a question.

_**Andrey:**_ Hey, hi man!

_**koe:**_ Hi. So in my case it’s like a meta question. In the long, long view how do you see cryptos on the world stage? So often I see people, when we talk about scaling and how far is it possible to scale, I often see people saying that it’s not worthwhile if we can’t scale all the way to whatever infinity. But from my point of view it’s not the upper bound that matters so much, is the impact you can make with whatever limit you can reach. So do you view what, how do you view, do you view the end goal is scaling all the way or do you feel it, view it that do as much as you can and that’s worthwhile?

_**Andrey:**_ You mean scale from technology perspective or scale from adoption?

_**koe:**_ Adoption.

_**Andrey:**_ Adoption? Oh, that’s the very general question, I’m not good in this and not good in visionary. But I can tell you something from my own experience being Russian, all these last year we had so much troubles with the sanctions, every few months one of my bank cards got canceled, one of my way of transact money was banned because of that. And just crypto became part of my life, because it’s just more usable, it’s more safe, it’s more reliable. I know that nobody gonna ban my money, nobody’s gonna steal it … ok it can be stolen, but I feel more protected. And wish more, more people will feel this way. Also after last events a lot of my friends, that was not connected to crypto in any way, but they needed to move to other countries, and they had to move the money abroad and they used crypto, and it was perfect, it worked perfectly well. And I believe that these use cases is, probably, a bad example, but this brings more and more people into crypto.

And that’s why I believe crypto has a great future. Just need more time. I basically have no doubts about the future of crypto since the last five years maybe. Because the first years I was, not skeptical, the first year of my work, on first month I was really skeptical what we are doing here, it’s like algorithm, what’s money, but after a year I was getting more and more into this, and see how great impact it makes on the people’s lives and the people freedoms — freedom of travel, freedom of earning money. So I have no doubts that crypto will take over the finance system and maybe 10 years maybe, 20 years — doesn’t matter how many years, but I believe that it will be there.

_**koe:**_ Thank you.

_**Doug:**_ All right, last question. Come on up. And then we’re going to move on to Rafael.

_**Audience:**_ Hi, I’m a big fan of the project.

_**Andrey:**_ Hi, and what project?

_**Audience:**_ Sorry. I’m a big fan of the project Zano. As I know, something that struck me when I read, and I know you weren’t involved directly with the paper, the CryptoNote paper, it mentions that it does, it’s very humble in a sense that it sees itself as complementary to the cryptosphere back then, people I don’t think who are as conscious of the privacy elements of, you know, when blockchain analysis comes into play and stuff like that. My question is do you even see a place or something that non-privacy focused cryptos does that privacy cryptos can’t do in the next 20 years or something?

_**Andrey:**_ Say it again, if I see…

_**Audience:**_ Did you see a value in non-privacy crypto, something they can do that we can’t.

_**Andrey:**_ This may be, there is a value because of technological reasons, because of as I said before. Whatever we do in the private blockchains, it’s so complicated, it’s way more harder even to create a simple like contracts, like stuff, things like. It’s blow my brain to create this all stuff, because everything is hidden, you have to make sure nothing gonna be screwed. So I think the value is simplicity and you can make more functionality, more features and a non-private blockchains. I think it’s gonna be probably at some point. It’s going to be some hybrid that’s gonna have a private and unprivate transactions like cash. And it’s going to be more stuff about that.

But yeah the value is the simplicity gives you more other opportunities from a technology perspective, not from value, but from technology perspective. Because the privacy also can be transparent if you want, if, for example, you having a private technology, you can create, for Zano we did an auditable wallets, so you can have a transparent wallet if you want it. For example the fund of Zano is transparent — everybody can see how much money is there. So from this perspective privacy is a cool thing, but it’s easier to create some other stuff, or it’s not even possible to create in a privacy blockchain. For example you don’t know, I mean, you can create a virtual machine on the blockchain, but you don’t know how to operate it —because you don’t have addresses, you don’t have amounts, you don’t have much of there. So there’s technological limitations, and that’s why I see the value. Also… that’s it.

_**Audience:**_ So you see that in collab it be…

_**Andrey:**_ Yes, not now in this moment, but in future something new will be invented, and it’s gonna be homomorphic calculations, that let us do in the privacy same stuff, and it’s done later then we can take over.

_**Doug:**_ Awesome last-last question.

_**Audience:**_ So why didn’t you continue to develop Monero. You saw Monero start to take off, and gain adoption, why not continue to contribute to Monero?

_**Andrey:**_ I did, there was a very negative to me. I had so much bad things from not everyone, but few peoples was very aggressive to me at the very beginning. So because, we talked about this at the beginning, and also as I was doing stuff, there was a lot of bad things said about me personally, a lot of personal attacks, then at some point Ricardo removed the copyright from code base of Monero, and that was like the bridge was burned, because…

_**Audience:**_ What did you say, what was the last part to that?

_**Andrey:**_ They rip off our copyright from the Monero code base. You still, by the way, you still can fix it. You can return our copyrights, guys. That was not nice yeah.

_**Doug:**_ Anybody got any response to that? Can you answer that?

_**Audience:**_ You say that you state the issue.

_**Andrey:**_ Well, one of the things that Monero developers, particularly Ricardo, one of his commits, he rip off, all our copyrights from code base. I never saw any other projects who did this.

_**Doug:**_ Is there’s any response guys from Monero devs? What’s it? Lot of things are go out. Wow, so we ended with the juicy answer to a juicy question. Any other comments on that?

_**Andrey:**_ No, no, I’m not blaming. I know that there is different people, a lot of contributors, and we have a lot of respect to our research team. koe was even helping us, he became co-author. That’s not addressed to current Monero community. I mean you can fix it if you want. But this problem was by personal people, it was done by Ricardo back then in 2014. So that’s my attitude was connected to this actions, practical actions, so yeah that’s why. I think no one would want to cooperate in that case. But now I just I try to pass over this, because it was in the past. We had a lot of fights there, I also was saying not nice, so I just preferred to leave. And what you’re doing actually is amazing. No one ever done this before Monero that you’re invited other projects to speak and to collaborate. That’s amazing guys, and that’s why…

_**Doug:**_ I hope he doesn’t backfire.

_**Andrey:**_ One of the reasons we are happy to be here, because of this stuff.

_**Doug:**_ Thank you. I learned that from the Monero community actually like so, you know, this idea of the true open source culture, that the best ideas win, let’s talk about them, debate them out and open. Andrey, man, thank you so much for your genuine Q&A. That was amazing, that was amazing guys.

_**Andrey:**_ Thank you guys.
